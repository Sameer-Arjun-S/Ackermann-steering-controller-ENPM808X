## Overview
This project uses Agile Iterative process for the implementation for a robot steering control module using the Ackermann kinematic model. The module gets the input of the robotâ€™s target heading and velocity to output the steering angle and drive wheel velocities to achieve
the required steering motion for the robot. The software team will work on this project through iterative software evolution and service processes and Agile Iterative Process (AIP) of software development will be used in the development process with Test-Driven Development approach. The team consists of 3 members and pair programming is implemented with one member working as the design keeper.
The classes of the future program and their responsibilities have been identified and their relations have been explained through UML class diagrams below.
